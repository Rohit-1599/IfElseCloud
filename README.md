# If Else Cloud - UI Assignment Project

## Project Status Update

Hi,

My project is almost complete, with the exception of the pagination bar. I have implemented all the major and minor UI components and handled the necessary requests.

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fully implement the ideal flow I would typically use in a real-world project. With more time, I believe the project could have been significantly improved from my side.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could review my code and provide feedback on the project.

Thank you!

## Incomplete Portions

- Pagination bar and buttons are missing.

---

## Approach

- Started with bare SCSS for initial layout.
- Developed a custom SCSS utility class design system using **Sass**, leveraging control statements, interpolations, and placeholders.
- Implemented reusable UI components such as:

  - **Badges**
  - **Progress bar**
  - **User listing component**
  - **Chart component**

  These components are designed to be reusable and configurable.

- Demonstrated project organization strategy by using a **shared module**, providing a glimpse into real-world structuring.
- Used **services** and **RxJS** for state management and subscription handling.

Thank you!
