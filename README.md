# If Else Cloud - UI assignemnt project

## Project Status Update

Hi,

My project is almost complete, with the exception of the pagination bar. I have implemented all the major and minor UI components and handled the necessary requests.

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fully implement the ideal flow I would typically use in a real-world project. With more time, I believe the project could have been significantly improved from my side.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could review my code and provide feedback on the project.

Thank you!
