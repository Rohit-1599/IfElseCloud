# If Else Cloud - UI Assignment Project

## Project Status Update

Hi,

Please find the screenshots inside the **`output`** folder.

## âœ… Approach

- Started with bare SCSS for initial layout and structure.
- Built a custom SCSS utility-based design system using **Sass** features such as:
  - Control statements
  - Interpolations
  - Placeholders
- Implemented reusable and configurable UI components:

  - **Badges**
  - **Progress Bar**
  - **User Listing Component**
  - **Chart Component**

  > **Note:** Badges, progress bar, and user listing components are fully responsive.

- Demonstrated project structure using a **Shared Module**, aligned with real-world Angular best practices.
- Utilized **services** and **RxJS** for state management and clean subscription handling.

Thank you!
